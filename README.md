# UFO_Basic_Repo
 Homework_Plus_Plotly_UFO

When this assignment was issued I began work on it and finished the first two parts in a couple of days, so I didn't employ the techniques described in later classes/  Later, when we covered Plotly, I decided to add another level of functionality to the web page as an exercise.  The end user can select three types of graphs, (line and scatter are the same), and the still preserve the filtering setup.
This is the first webpage I have ever written with virtually anything of substance, so it has been fun.

I am going to attempt linking up a MongoDB database with a huge UFO database in the second project.  To do that I will have to set up a server using Node.  I have already processed the data with Python, at least initially.  The master database has 112,000 sightings that have be accounted in detail.  As a project, it will be interesting to analize the verbiage and sighting history.
